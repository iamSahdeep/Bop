/**
 * Service that makes the music play and notifies every action.
 * <p>
 * Tasks:
 * <p>
 * - Abstracts controlling the native Android MediaPlayer;
 * - Keep showing a system Notification with info on
 * currently playing song;
 * - Starts the other service, `MusicScrobblerService`
 * (if set on Settings) that scrobbles songs to Last.fm;
 * - LocalBroadcasts every action it takes;
 * - Keep watching for headphone/headset events with
 * a Broadcast - and react accordingly.
 * <p>
 * Broadcasts:
 * <p>
 * This service makes sure to broadcast every action it
 * takes.
 * <p>
 * It sends a LocalBroadcast of name `BROADCAST_EVENT_NAME`,
 * of which you can get it's action with the following
 * extras:
 * <p>
 * - String BROADCAST_EXTRA_ACTION: Current action it's taking.
 * <p>
 * - Long   BROADCAST_EXTRA_SONG_ID: ID of the Song it's taking
 * action into.
 * <p>
 * For example, see the following scenarios:
 * <p>
 * - Starts playing Song with ID 1.
 * + Send a LocalBroadcast with `BROADCAST_EXTRA_ACTION`
 * of `BROADCAST_EXTRA_PLAYING` and
 * `BROADCAST_EXTRA_SONG_ID` of 1.
 * <p>
 * - User skips to a Song with ID 2:
 * + Send a LocalBroadcast with `BROADCAST_EXTRA_ACTION`
 * of `BROADCAST_EXTRA_SKIP_NEXT` and
 * `BROADCAST_EXTRA_SONG_ID` of 1.
 * + Send a LocalBriadcast with `BROADCAST_EXTRA_ACTION`
 * of `BROADCAST_EXTRA_PLAYING` and
 * `BROADCAST_EXTRA_SONG_ID` of 2.
 *
 * @note It keeps the music playing even when the
 * device is locked.
 * For that, we must add a special permission
 * on the AndroidManifest.
 * <p>
 * Thanks:
 * - Google's MediaPlayer guide - has info on AudioFocus,
 * Services and lotsa stuff
 * http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediaplayer.html
